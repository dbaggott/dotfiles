# Issues

## Bash

- [ ] If the ~/.bash_profile.d symlink already exists, another one will be created inside the directory.
- [ ] I haven't actually tested, but I suspect the install script will shit the bed if you run it outside the `/bash` directory.

## Vim

- [ ] The install script doesn't install .vimrc.
- [ ] The install script doesn't install the neovim init script.
- [ ] Again, I think this will do crazy stuff if run outside the `/vim` directory.


## Misc

- [ ] No install script for ctags, tmux.conf, gitconfig.

## Not actually issues, but still TODOs

- [ ] Consolidated install script for all files.
- [ ] Install script for homebrew and packages.
- [ ] Init script for git, hub credentials.
- [ ] Add an alias for macdown.
- [ ] ???
